## Introduction

Thomdoro ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our Pomodoro timer application.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide
- **Music Service Integration**: When you connect your Spotify or Apple Music account, we access playback controls to enable music during timer sessions. We do not store your account credentials.

### Automatically Collected Information
- **Timer Usage Data**: We store your timer settings (work duration, break duration, session counts) locally on your device.
- **App Preferences**: Your customization preferences and settings are stored locally on your device.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information to:
- Operate and maintain the timer functionality
- Control music playback during work and break sessions
- Display timer status in Live Activities on your lock screen
- Sync timer state across the app and widget extension
- Remember your preferences and settings

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage Only**: All timer data and preferences are stored locally on your device using iOS secure storage mechanisms (UserDefaults, App Groups).
- **No Cloud Storage**: We do not transmit, store, or process your data on external servers.
- **No Account Required**: The app does not require you to create an account or provide personal information.

## Third-Party Services

### Music Service Integration
- The app integrates with Spotify and Apple Music to control music playback

- We do not collect, store, or share your listening history or personal data from these services

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or transfer your information to third parties. Your timer data remains private and stored exclusively on your device.

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age. The app is designed for general audiences and does not target children.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

### For EU Users (GDPR Compliance)

If you are located in the European Union, you have additional rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):

- **Right of Access**: You have the right to access your personal data. Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have direct access at all times.
- **Right to Erasure**: You can delete all your data by uninstalling the app from your device.
- **Right to Data Portability**: Since we do not store your data on our servers, data portability is not applicable.
- **Right to Object**: You have the right to object to data processing. All data processing occurs locally on your device under your control.
- **Data Controller**: Since we do not collect or process personal data on servers, there is no data controller in the traditional GDPR sense. All data remains under your direct control on your device.

**Legal Basis for Processing**: Our legal basis for processing is your consent, provided when you configure the app's settings and choose to integrate with music services.

**Data Retention**: We do not retain data on our servers. All data persists on your device until you choose to delete it or uninstall the app.
